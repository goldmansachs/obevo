package com.gs.obevo.impl.command;
/**
 * This package defines the commands and interfaces that can be applied against an {@link com.gs.obevo.api.appdata.Environment}.
 *
 * The full set of incremental deployment logic should work based on the classes here, e.g. in terms of when to deploy
 * vs undeploy/rollback, whether there are any hash mismatch issues, ...
 *
 * In terms of "how" the deployments are applied to the environments, that is elsewhere (e.g. {@link com.gs.obevo.api.platform.ChangeType}).
