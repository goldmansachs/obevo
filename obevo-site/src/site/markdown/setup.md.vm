$h1 Setup Obevo

You can download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/goldmansachs/obevo/releases)

* [Latest Release - ${project.version}](https://github.com/goldmansachs/obevo/releases/download/${project.version}/obevo-cli-${project.version}-dist.zip)

For access via other APIs or build tools, please see the relevant pages:

* [Java](java-api.html)
* [Maven](maven-api.html)
* [Gradle](gradle-api.html)

$h2 Setting up your Obevo distribution

Obevo is licensed as Apache 2.0; thus, any proprietary dependencies (notably any proprietary JDBC drivers) cannot be
included in the distributions that we create.

As of this writing, this applies to the following DBMS types:

* DB2
* Oracle
* Sybase ASE
* Sybase IQ

To use Obevo with these databases, you will need to acquire the JDBC drivers yourself and include them in the distribution
as follows:

$h3 Zip binary distribution

Add the JDBC drivers to the /lib folder


$h3 Java API

Add the JDBC drivers to your classpath using whichever method is relevant for your developer setup

$h3 Maven API

Add the JDBC drivers to your Maven repository and declare them as dependencies in your pom file, per the &lt;dependencies&gt; tag example below

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>${project.parent.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>obevo-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
