# DB Project Structure

Obevo allows users to maintain their database scripts in an object-based
structure, such as the structure below. This page describes how to
implement this.

![DB Project Structure](images/db-kata-file-setup.jpg)

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=0|toDepth=1} -->

## system-config.xml

### Base Structure

The system-config.xml file is the starting point of your db source code.
Hence, the directory containing it is your db root folder

-   It is located under src/main/database to abide by Maven conventions;
    however, this is not mandatory

system-config.xml defines:

-   The <u><i>logical schemas</i></u>
    that this unit of code would maintain (in this example, we only
    maintain 1 logical schema DEMOSCHEMA)
    -   By logical schema - we refer to the schema that we would ideally
        see in a particular production environment
    -   Compare this to the <u><i>physical schema</i></u>, which may have a suffix appended depending on the environment
        -   e.g. in prod, we have DEMOSCHEMA
        -   in uat, we have DEMO_SCHEMA_UAT1
        -   in dev, we have DEMO_SCHEMA_DEV1
        -   and so on
    -   The logical schema name should only contain alphanumeric
        characters and underscores
    -   <font color="red">NOTE for Sybase ASE and SQL Server users: The "schema" term in
        Obevo is equivalent to the Sybase ASE "database"</font>. By default,
        we assume the default user during SQL execution. See the section
        below on how to use the database + schema.
-   The <u><i>db environments</i></u>
    that we plan on deploying to
    -   e.g. dev1 environments deploys to myserver1.dev.me.com:1234,
        prod deploys to myserver1.prod.me.com:1234

You can read the provided [system-config.xml
file](https://github.com/goldmansachs/obevo-kata/tree/master/src/main/database/system-config.xml)
for some of the features and configurations that you can define

A couple of the key configs to note (see the xml example for details):

### Defining your DB Connection

You can define your DB connection in 3 different ways:

-   via the jdbcUrl attribute, where you simply provide the JDBC url;
    e.g. db2://myhost1.me.com:1234/MYSERVER
-   via the dbHost, dbSchema, and dbServer attributes, where you provide
    those and the underlying JDBC url is constructed for you; e.g.
    dbHost="myhost1.me.com" dbPort="1234" dbServer="MYSERVER1"
-   via the dbDataSourceName, where you provide the LDAP name and the
    tool will look up the source in LDAP; e.g.
    dbDataSourceName=MYSERVER1

### Schema Suffix or Prefix Convention

The dbSchemaPrefix and/or dbSchemaSuffix attributes can be used to add a
prefix or suffix across your logical schemas when pointing to a
particular environment

-   This is to help enforce the convention of having a consistent schema
    naming convention across environments
    -   e.g. \<SCHEMA_NAME>\<ENVIRONMENT_SUFFIX>
    -   From anecdotal evidence, most teams go w/ the suffix convention,
        but a few go w/ prefixes, e.g.
        \<ENVIRONMENT_PREFIX>\<SCHEMA_NAME>
-   In case your system already has the schemas defined and need to
    define the schema names outside of this convention, you can use the
    \<schemaOverrides\> element.
    -   Note that the overrideValue will override even the environment
        suffix/prefix convention if you have specified it
    -   See the example below:
    -   For SQL Server and Sybase ASE, this value applies to the
        database used for your objects. See the next section for schema
        handling

```
<!--schema override example -->
<dbSystemConfig type="DB2">
    <schemas>
        <schema name="SCHEMA1" />
        <schema name="SCHEMA2" />
        <schema name="SCHEMA3" />
    </schemas>
    <environments>
        <dbEnvironment name="test" dbServer="example" ...>
            <schemaOverrides>
                <schemaOverride schema="SCHEMA1" overrideValue="my_schema1abc" />
                <schemaOverride schema="SCHEMA2" overrideValue="my_schema2def" />
                <!-- you don't have to specify an override if you don't want to, say for SCHEMA3 in this example. Then, it will just take the original value -->
            </schemaOverrides>
            ...
        </dbEnvironment>
    </environments>
</dbSystemConfig>
```

### \[For SQL Server and Sybase ASE\] database.schema convention

By default, Obevo will refer to an object by its default
catalog/database. For example:

-   In DB2: schema1.object1
-   In SQL Server: schema1..object1 (note the extra period)

We imply the schema user here (e.g. dbo - schema1.dbo.object1)

If you need to define your objects in a schema within the database,
consider the following:

-   If you want to manage multiple schemas within your database, you
    will need to map each database+schema combination to a logical
    schema
-   Use the schemaOverride element to define the database/schema
    combination, e.g.

```
<!--schema override example -->
<dbSystemConfig type="SYBASE_ASE">
    <schemas>
        <schema name="SCHEMA1" />
        <schema name="SCHEMA2" />
    </schemas>
    <environments>
    <dbEnvironment name="test" ...>
        <schemaOverrides>
            <!-- note - many logical schemas can map to different schemas within the same database -->
            <schemaOverride schema="SCHEMA1" overrideValue="mydatabase.myschema1" />
            <schemaOverride schema="SCHEMA2" overrideValue="mydatabase.myschema2" />
        </schemaOverrides>
        ...
    </dbEnvironment>
    </environments>
</dbSystemConfig>
```

-   In your DB object code, if you need to refer to the schema, then you
    can use the tokens \<logicalSchema\>_schemaSuffixed and
    \<logicalSchema\>_subschemaSuffixed to give you either the
    "mydatabase.myschema1." token value or "myschema1." token value,
    respectively

```
CREATE TABLE ${SCHEMA1_subschemaSuffixed}myobject ( ... )
```

### Advanced Environment Management

You can do more advanced environment management with Obevo, including
tokenization, permission management, and environment-specific
deployments.

See the [Environment Management page](environment-management.html) for
more information, though you should first understand the rest of this
page and the DB project structure basics.


## Schema folders

Underneath your root folder, you should define a folder for each of the
logical schemas that you will maintain in this module.

For each schema, you will then define the table, sp, view, data, ...
folders


## Separating Schema Packaging from Config

In some use cases, you may want to separate the directories in which your config and your schema folders reside.

It is worth going through the rest of this page first to understand the basics. But if you do want to explore
separating your config and schemas, please see the [schema-and-config-packaging](schema-and-config-packaging.html) page
for more details.


## File Structure (for all object types)

### Structure

Your table definitions will go under the table folder in the schemas

As mentioned in the intro doc, the goal here is to promote a
db-object-oriented structure for your code base. Hence:

-   Particular object types are rooted under folders of that name (e.g.
    tables go in /table, stored procedures under /sp, /view, /function,
    /data, /sequence, and so on)
-   Changes for a particular db object will go into a file named of that
    object, e.g.

```
table/PRODUCT.sql
table/ACCOUNT.ddl
table/ENTITY.sql
table/codes/NET_TYPE.sql
table/codes/INSTRUMENT.ddl
table/codes/PROD_TYPE.fx.abc.sql
table/codes/PROD_TYPE.fi.abc.sql
view/V_PRODUCT.sql
view/V_ENTITY.sql
sp/CREATE_PRODUCT.ddl
data/codes/INSTRUMENT.sql
data/NET_TYPE.csv
```


### Naming rules / flexibilities

The only rules to consider here are:

1.  The DB object name should be the first segment of the file name
    (i.e. before the first dot)
    1.  e.g. PRODUCT.sql would correspond to a table named PRODUCT
    2.  e.g. ACCOUNT.sql would correspond to a table named ACCOUNT
    3.  e.g. PROD_TYPE.fx.abc.sql would correspond to a table named
        PROD_TYPE (i.e. the intermediate .fx.abc. does not matter
2.  The DB object names must be unique for a particular environment
    (e.g. multiple files for DB objects named PRODUCT cannot be defined
    for a particular environment)
    1.  In a later section, we will show how to have
        environment-specific inclusions/exclusions of objects, which
        would allow the structure involving PROD_TYPE.fi.abc.sql and
        PROD_TYPE.fx.abc.sql above (not that we encourage doing this a
        lot)

In terms of what you are flexible with:

-   You can define your table files anywhere under /table, i.e. you can
    put them in subdirectories
-   The extension does not matter - can be ddl, sql, txt, whatever

This applies for all object types


### Common content conventions

You can use the \${token} convention to replace tokens that you've
defined in system-config.xml

Now we discuss the specific content rules for each of the object types

Stored procedures, views, and data are very easy to define in Obevo; but
given that tables are focal point of databases, we will start there


## Defining Table Changes

Below is an example of a table file. We will describe below:

```
//// CHANGE name=chng1
CREATE TABLE TABLE_A (
    A_ID    INT NOT NULL,
    B_ID    INT NOT NULL,
    STRING_FIELD    VARCHAR(30) NULL,
    TIMESTAMP_FIELD TIMESTAMP   NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (A_ID)
)
GO
//// CHANGE name=chng3
ALTER TABLE TABLE_A ADD COLUMN C_ID INT NULL
GO
//// CHANGE name=chng2
ALTER TABLE TABLE_A ADD FOREIGN KEY FK_B (B_ID) REFERENCES TABLE_B(B_ID)
GO
//// CHANGE name=mytrigger
CREATE TRIGGER mytrigger ON TABLE_A
FOR abc123 ...
GO
//// CHANGE name=extra1
ALTER TABLE TABLE_A ADD COLUMN EXTRA1 INT NULL
GO
```

Basically, all alters on a table (including CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE,
adding constraints, adding indexes, adding FKs or triggers) will go into
this file

Each change for a particular release or functionality should be
demarcated using the "//// CHANGE name=123" annotation

-   The name must be distinct *within* the file. The same name could
    exist in different files
-   A convention that teams have used for the name is to use the JIRA
    ticket number of the issue orcommit

If you use the global permissions functionality, you do not need to
define GRANT statements in your files! The tool will automatically
execute these for you upon detecting a "CREATE TABLE" phrase
(whitespace between CREATE and TABLE is taken care of)

### Immutable //// CHANGE sections

Once a change is deployed to an environment, **<u>_it cannot be modified or deleted_</u>**.

-   You must create a new alter statement. This is required to guarantee
    that we can always replay all the changes in a DB file to recreate
    the schema from scratch
-   Modifying white-space is fine; the tool will tolerate that. But
    changing actual content will fail.
-   Fyi, the tool does this by taking a MD5 hash of the change content
    and storing it in the audit table

(\*) - For special cases (e.g. undoing a change deployed to UAT but not
prod), a //// CHANGE can be removed with a special directive in the
code. See the [Rollback](rollback.html) page for details.

### Dropping tables and removing table files

Given that changes are immutable, can I drop a table and then remove a
file? Yes, but with special directives. We do not want to just delete a
file and have the table dropped, as we can't foresee any cases of
accidentally dropping or renaming a file; we want to be conservative in
this case

Steps for dropping a table:

1.  Add a new change w/ the DROP_TABLE toggle, per the following
    example. Note that no SQL needs to be provided; in the future, we
    will allow users to enter their own SQL in that section to execute.

```
//// CHANGE name=chng1
CREATE TABLE TABLE_DROP (
    ID INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
)
GO

//// CHANGE name=drop DROP_TABLE
```

2.  Deploy this change across all environments to drop the table. This
    will also clear the DeployLog table of this object.
3.  You are then free to delete the file from your source code. Note
    that if you were to deploy your source code to a brand new DB, then
    this file will not get deployed (the existence of the DROP_TABLE
    command will preclude it).


### Renaming tables

You have a couple options on renaming tables in Obevo

#### Option 1: Create the new table and migrate the data over

The migration SQL should be in a /migration change (described in the
sections below), so that the object files remain clean

The changes will also need the dependencies attributes to ensure
ordering of the files (see the subsequent sections for more information
on migrations and dependencies)

\#\#\# /table/OrigTable.sql

```
//// CHANGE name="init"
CREATE TABLE OrigTable (
    Field1 int,
    Field2 int
)
GO
//// CHANGE name="dropOld" DROP_TABLE dependencies="OldToNewTableMigration.migration"
```

\#\#\# /table/NewTable.sql

```
//// CHANGE name="init"
CREATE TABLE NewTable (
    NewField1 int,
    NewField2 int
)
```

\#\#\# /migration/OldToNewTableMigration.sql

```
//// CHANGE name="migration" includeDependencies="OrigTable.init,NewTable.init"
INSERT INTO NewTable (NewField1, NewField2)
SELECT Field1, Field2 FROM OrigTable
GO
```


#### Option 2: Use the rename command provided by the DBMS

As of this version, doing this in Obevo is a bit clunky, as you won't
be able to delete the old file, and the new file would not have the DDL
defined. Suggestions to work around this for now:

-   If you need this for in-memory testing, use the workarounds for
    manually defining a translation SQL defined [here](in-memory-db-testing)
-   If you want to redefine the new file to define the change SQL in a
    cleaner way, see the [re-baselining documentation](incremental-change-code-cleanup.html).

\#\#\# /table/OrigTable.sql

```
//// CHANGE name="init"
CREATE TABLE OrigTable (
    Field1 int,
    Field2 int
)
GO
//// CHANGE name="dropOld" DROP_TABLE dependencies="OldToNewTableMigration.migration"
```

\#\#\# /table/NewTable.sql

```
//// CHANGE name="init" dependencies="OrigTable.init"
sp_rename 'OrigTable', 'NewTable'
-- Note - sp_rename is specific for Sybase. May be different for other DBMS types; this is just an example.
```


## Defining Rerunnable Object Changes (Stored Procedures, Views, Functions, ...)

This spans the following object types (and this would be the directory structure you'd apply for each)

|Object Type|Directory|Vendor-specific Note|
|-----------|---------|--------------------|
|Stored Procedures|/sp||
|Views|/view||
|Functions|/function||
|Sequences|/sequence||
|Triggers|/trigger||
|User Types|/usertype|Only Sybase ASE and MS SQL Server|
|Rule|/rule|Only Sybase ASE and MS SQL Server|
|Default|/default|Only Sybase ASE and MS SQL Server|
|Packages + Package Bodies|/routinepackage|Only for Oracle|
|Synonyms|/synonym|Currently only for Oracle; other vendors will be supported later|

Here is an example:

```
CREATE PROCEDURE SP1 ()
LANGUAGE SQL DYNAMIC RESULT SETS 1
BEGIN ATOMIC
    CALL SP2(2);
    CALL SP2(3);
END
GO
```

That's it! Just a matter of creating, editing, and deleting the file;
just like Java. i.e.

-   To create the SP/view/..., create the file w/ the create statement
    content (along w/ adding the grants if you've defined the global
    permissions)
-   To edit the SP/view/..., edit the file. Obevo will do the drop/add
    for you (along w/ re-adding the grants if you've defined the global
    permissions)
-   To drop the SP/view/..., delete the file. Obevo will do the drop
    for you


### Best practices for rerunnable objects

Use "CREATE OR REPLACE" to create the object if your DBMS supports it, so that dependent objects do not have to be
recreated as is needed for some DBs.

Likewise, if there are other syntax features of your DBMS (besides CREATE OR REPLACE) that you can use to create objects
without recreating dependents, please do so. (See [Redshift doc page](redshift-notes.html) for an example of this.

Do not define the "DROP PROCEDURE/VIEW/..." statement in your file. Obevo does it for you.



### Side use-case for SPs with function overloads

For cases where you have SPs of the same name, but different argument
lengths, those should be defined in the same file

Obevo will take care of dropping each of the instances as needed


### Objects with BODY components, e.g. Oracle packages

Some database objects, such as [Oracle
packages](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14261/packages.htm),
are defined across two SQL statements: a declaration of the object
signature, and its implementation.

The implementation can be more complex, esp. with referring to other
objects, and so we would not want to force the two to be deployed in
sequence.

Hence, we allow the file content to be split in two using the "////
BODY" line; the content preceding that line is the signature, and
afterward the implementation body. See below for an example:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE MY_EXAMPLE_PACKAGE
AS
    FUNCTION MY_FUNC1 return integer;
    FUNCTION MY_FUNC2(var1 IN integer) return integer;
END;
GO

//// BODY
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY MY_EXAMPLE_PACKAGE
AS
    FUNCTION MY_FUNC1
    RETURN integer IS
    BEGIN
        RETURN 1;
    END;

    FUNCTION MY_FUNC2 (var1 IN integer)
    RETURN integer IS
    BEGIN
        RETURN 1;
    END;
END;
GO
```


## DB Object Deployment Order

A key tenet of Obevo is to not require excessive overhead on developers
to define the order of db changes for **<u>every single change</u>** , e.g. via a sequence file or a versioning
convention. It tries to be similar to application languages, e.g. Java,
where users do not worry about the compilation order of classes within a
module.

Obevo takes care of this by:

1.  Inferring dependency order across objects by inspecting the text
2.  Allowing users to explicitly define a dependency order if needed to
    override the default behavior

See the [Design Walkthrough](design-walkthrough.html#Sorting_Changes_in_the_file-per-object_format)
for more details on how this is done.

Specific steps on applying this to your code:

### Automatic Inference of Order Based on the Code

Order across all object types is inferred automatically based on the
code of the object or CHANGE, except:

-   staticdata: The dependencies are inferred based on the foreign key
    relations defined in the associated table change
-   migration: No automatic inference is done. Users will have to define
    dependencies explicitly

Note: cross-schema object dependencies cannot yet be inferred. Please use the explicit dependency specification for
those use cases, described next.

### Explicit dependency definition by users to override/supplement the inferred dependency

To define the dependency explicitly, add the "dependencies",
"includeDependencies", or "excludeDependencies" value to either the
//// CHANGE line (for incremental changes) or //// METADATA line (for
rerunnable objects)

The value is a comma-separated string that points to the dependencies of
that change:

-   dependencies: overrides the value inferred by Obevo entirely w/ what
    the user provides
-   includeDependencies: adds the given dependencies to the value
    inferred by Obevo
-   excludeDependencies: removes the given dependencies from the value
    inferred by Obevo

When to use each:

-   excludeDependencies is the most common use case, as you will usually
    have to exclude the false positives from the dependency detection
    (e.g. from comments and strings)
-   includeDependencies is for rarer cases, say if you need to include a
    cross-schema object dependency
-   dependencies is useful for "migration" change types (see below)
    that really require explicit dependency ordering

String format for each dependency is one of the following:

-   \[objectName\]
-   \[objectName\].\[changeName\]
-   \[logicalSchemaName\].\[objectName\]
-   \[logicalSchemaName\].\[objectName\].\[changeName\]

(Reminder: use the logicalSchemaName here - not the physical schema name)

Examples:

-   //// METADATA dependencies="sp1,sp2" =>would force the
    dependencies of the object to be sp1,sp2
-   //// METADATA excludeDependencies="schema1.sp3" => would exclude
    schema1.sp3 from the automatic dependency calculation
-   //// CHANGE name="chng1" includeDependencies="myobject.chngABC"
    => would include myobject.chngABC in the dependency calculation


### Tie-break logic for consistent order

After the dependencies are declared, the changes are deployed respecting
that order using[Topological
Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).
Apart from those mandated dependency orders, the sort order will break
ties based on the following change types:

1.  Sequences
2.  Table changes
3.  Functions
4.  Views
5.  Stored Procedures
6.  Migrations
7.  Static Data


## Managing Static Data / Code Tables

Many systems store tables just for static/code data, not necessarily
dynamic data.

For these cases, Obevo supports maintaining these as rerunnable files,
such that if you wanted to add/modify/delete a row, you can just edit
the file content in place, instead of having to specifically code to an
incremental update statement.

These would go under the /staticdata folder in your schema (i.e. at the
same level as /table, /sp, /view, etc.

Within that folder, you can use 2 methodologies for organizing your
data, depending on which use case fits you better. (both can coexist
within that folder and be used for different tables in the folder)

### Methodology 1) File-per-table (the common use case)

Here, we define a file per code table (i.e. the same paradigm that we
use for the other objects in obevo, like tables/sps/views/etc.)

e.g. say we want to maintain static data for 3 tables, VIEW*DEF,
VIEW*COLUMN, COLUMNDEF; the directory would look like this:

```
/myschema/staticdata
/myschema/staticdata/VIEW_DEF.csv
/myschema/staticdata/VIEW_COLUMN.sql
/myschema/staticdata/COLUMN_DEF.csv
```

In terms of the actual content format of that file (i.e. how to
represent the static data), you have two options:


### Content Option A) via simple delete/insert statements

See the example below; hence, every time you change this file, the
script will be rerun (delete all, insert all)

This is a simple option and what you'd be used to if doing manual
deployments; but if you want a nicer form of representation (or just
don't want to delete all your rows for a deployment), then try the CSV
option...

```
DELETE FROM COLUMN_DEF
GO
INSERT INTO COLUMN_DEF (COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, ADD_TIME) VALUES (20, 'col1', '2012-01-01 12:12:12')
GO
INSERT INTO COLUMN_DEF (COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, ADD_TIME) VALUES (21, 'col2', '2013-01-01 11:11:11.65432')
GO
INSERT INTO COLUMN_DEF (COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, ADD_TIME) VALUES (22, 'col3', null)
GO
INSERT INTO COLUMN_DEF (COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, ADD_TIME) VALUES (50, 'txncol1', null)
GO
INSERT INTO COLUMN_DEF (COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, ADD_TIME) VALUES (51, 'txncol2', '2012-01-01 12:12:12')
GO
INSERT INTO COLUMN_DEF (COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, ADD_TIME) VALUES (52, 'txncol3', '2013-01-01 11:11:11.65432')
GO
```


### Content Option B) via CSV (the preferred method)

```
COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, ADD_TIME
20, "col1", "2012-01-01 12:12:12"
21, "col2", "2013-01-01 11:11:11.65432"
22, "col3", null
50, "txncol1", null
51, "txncol2", "2012-01-01 12:12:12"
52, "txncol3", "2013-01-01 11:11:11.65432"
```

Just define a CSV file (quotes are supported, as is changing the comma
delimiter and null token) with the first row as the column names, and
you are set

If a change is done on the table, Obevo will only deploy the incremental
change (it will compare the full dataset in the db table vs. the file
and apply the appropriate insert/update/delete)

Note that there is reverse-engineering available to make this easy to
onboard for existing projects (see below)

A specific requirement - the table must have a primary key or unique
index defined, whether physically on the table, or configured in code.
Specifically:

-   Define a primary key or unique index if one doesn't exist already
    (it would be bad practice not to have it)
-   Or define a metadata attribute as follows:

```
//// METADATA primaryKeys="field1,field2"
field1,field2,value
a,b,11
c,d,22
```

-   If you can't do either, then just use the delete/insert
    representation


### Note on this methodology with respect to tables related by foreign key (CSV mode is required)

If you have tables that depend on each other via foreign key,
<u>_you must use the CSV format_</u> (which is the preference anyway).

The reason here is that if you have inserts/updates/deletes spanning
those related tables, the operations need to be done in the correct
foreign-key dependency order.

For example:

-   Say that TableA depends on TableB, and TableB depends on TableC. And
    you want to insert static data for all those tables
-   Then, the inserts must first be done in TableC, then TableB, then
    TableA
-   However, the deletions must be done in the *reverse* order (TableA,
    then TableB, then TableC)

Lucky for you, Obevo takes care of this!

-   Obevo knows how your tables are related to each other via FK
    (assuming you've defined those foreign keys in your table DDLs in
    the first place), and thus can manage the dependency order
    accordingly on the CSV side
-   Simply edit the CSV files as you need to, and Obevo takes care of
    the rest


### Methodology 2) File-per-staticDataGroup (i.e. common static data across a set of tables)

Some use cases lend themselves towards representing static data not per
table, but for a set of tables involving a particular context

An example is the DIAT tool from the Reg Ops IT team - adding DIAT views
spans across multiple tables with those rows being linked to each other;
but the rows per DIAT view do not interact with other rows in those
tables. Hence, it is preferable to keep these separate.

Hence, your files may make sense to represent like this (taking the same
content above, but represent it in the staticDataGroup mode)

```
### position-view.sql ###
delete from view where view_id = 1
delete from column_def where column_id in (20,21,22)
delete from view_columns where view_id = 1

insert into view (1, "position")

insert into view_columns (1, 20)
insert into view_columns (1, 21)
insert into view_columns (1, 22)

insert into column_def (20, "col1")
insert into column_def (21, "col2")
insert into column_def (22, "col3")
```

```
### transaction-view.sql ###
delete from view where view_id = 5
delete from column_def where column_id in (20,21,22)
delete from view_columns where view_id = 5

insert into view (5, "transaction")

insert into view_columns (5, 50)
insert into view_columns (5, 51)
insert into view_columns (5, 52)

insert into column_def (50, "txncol1")
insert into column_def (51, "txncol2")
insert into column_def (52, "txncol3")
```

Note that:

-   We use delete-insert for this methodology. CSV is not yet supported
    for this, but will be in the future
-   Each file needs the deletes to come first in the first so that this
    script can be rerunnable, then followed by the inserts. The
    deletes/inserts should follow the appropriate FK order (i.e. delete
    the dependents first, insert the dependencies first)

Though the file name is not strictly a "db-object" view at this point,
it is still a rerunnable script and makes more sense from a
maintainability perspective, so go right ahead and do it if it makes
sense for your use case!


## Ad-hoc data migrations

Note from the author to those who read this section for past versions:
yes, this text has changed a lot :) - we now support ad-hoc data
migrations, as we recognize that some teams are fine to do
backwards-incompatible changes whereas others do not. Will explain more
below.

### Explaining the use case

Use this for one-time data migrations on your transactional tables (i.e.
not the static data tables).

Note that these kinds of SQLs can easily be executed within the /table
files themselves, as ultimately those just execute SQLs. In fact, the
format of the /migration files is the same as the format of the /table
files.

So when would you define the changes in /migration files vs. /table
files?

**<u>Migrations in /table file?</u>**: Very simple backfills of newly added columns (e.g. the snippet below)

```
alter table TABLE_A add new column MYCOL
GO
update TABLE_A set MYCOL = 0
GO
```


**<u>Migrations in /migration file?]</u>**: some use cases:

-   If the migration involved multiple tables; thus, it wouldn't make
    sense to house this in a table-specific file.
-   A one-time update that you don't want to see continuously executed
    as part of your schema definition, say for your test schemas or
    in-memory db schemas or correcting missing GRANT statements.
-   For backwards-incompatible updates, where some new column/table
    needs to be populated from the old one, and then the old
    column/table needs to be dropped.
-   See the example below (note the "dependencies" attribute in the
    removeOldCol change and migration2 file that [we mentioned above](#DB_Object_Deployment_Order)): splitting the migration into a
    separate section lets us clearly see what the schema should look
    like in the /table file, while letting the migration be defined
    elsewhere.

```
{/table/TABLE_A.sql file}
//// CHANGE name="init"
CREATE TABLE TABLE_A (COL1 INT, COL2 INT, ...)
GO
//// CHANGE name="addNewCol2"
ALTER TABLE TABLE_A ADD NEWCOL2 (INT)
GO

//// CHANGE name="removeOldCol" dependencies="migration2.step1"
ALTER TABLE TABLE_A DROP COL2
GO

{/migration/migration2.sql file}
//// CHANGE name="step1" dependencies="TABLE_A.addNewCol2"
UPDATE TABLE_A SET NEWCOL2 = COL2 + 1
GO
```

### Usage Details

1) Define the files in the /migration folder

2) File content is the same as for tables, i.e.

-   Use //// CHANGE entries as needed.
-   //// METADATA section and attributes like includeEnvs/excludeEnvs
    still apply.

Differences from /table representation:

A) The file name need not correspond to a db-object name. You are free
to name this as you please.

B) You ***are allowed to delete /migration CHANGE entriesafter being
deployed*** . This is because we don't want/need migrations lying
around in the code, as they are one-time activities. Deleting the
entries will *UNMANAGE* them from Obevo, akin to the *UNMANAGE*/delete
operation with static data tables. i.e. if the migration file is
deleted, the entry is removed from the audit table, and Obevo leaves the
table untouched otherwise.
