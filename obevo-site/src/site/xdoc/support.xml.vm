        <section name="Supported DBMSs and major versions">
            <p>Obevo runs its integration tests against live DBMS environments. We aim to run as many tests as
            possible against a public cloud provider such that all developers can easily run tests and receive immediate
            feedback.</p>
            <p>Some DBMS types and versions are not available in the public cloud, so those tests are run in locales
                where the software exists. The test feedback loop in that case will be manual - the code would have to
                be pulled within those environments for tests to run there. If a failure is noted, a core contributor
                will contact the developer who made the relevant change.</p>
            <p>Our code is structured to make it easy for clients to set up their own test suites in-house, in case you
            have other environment types and versions that are not listed here. We will post more info on this soon -
            if you would like to leverage this now, please reach out to the development team</p>
