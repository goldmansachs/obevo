        Welcome to the Obevo Home Page. This tool and most of this wiki focuses on Database Deployment

        <section name="Feature List">
            <ul>
                <li>Organized maintenance of all your DB-object files (tables, stored procedures, views, static data)
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 file per object - just as you would with Java files</li>
                        <li>Edit stored procedures, views, and static data files in place (if you have them) - just as you would with Java files</li>
                        <li>No need to specify the order in which to deploy your files - Obevo figures it out for you (a la a Java compiler compiling classes)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Deploys to DB2, Sybase ASE, Sybase IQ</li>
                <li>In-memory DB support - convert your scripts to an in-memory database for unit testing support</li>
                <li>Easy onboarding - get your production schema checked in and deployed to other environments in under 2 hours</li>
                <li>Runnable from Java, command-line, or maven</li>
                <li>Easy integration into your SDLC and deployment - package and deploy alongside your Java code and run a simple command like this:</li>
                <li>$OBEVO_HOME/bin/deploy.sh -dir /home/myuser/myproject/latest-version/db -env prod</li>
                <li>Extra features like cleaning and rebuilding existing schemas and detecting/firing reorgs</li>
            </ul></section>
        <section name="How to read this doc">
        <ul>
            <li>Sections 1-6 are intro information</li>
            <li>Section 7 is how to onboard an {+}{+}<i>existing</i> system; (for new systems, sections 1-6
                would suffice)
            </li>
            <li>Sections 8-onward are advanced use cases</li>
        </ul>
