        <section name="In-memory DBs for unit testing">
            <p>DeployAnywhere can create an in-memory db from your existing SQLs, thus guaranteeing that the same
            DDLs you use to deploy to prod are the same ones for your testing</p>

            Some translation happens to ensure that your prod SQLs work against an in-mem environment (notably to
            simplify some SQLs, as we don't need to support as much rich logic in an in-mem environment)
            <ul>
                <li>Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers are not deployed (very hard to unit-test these, or the SQL varies too much between the live dbs and the in-memory dbs)</li>
                <li>See the other translations done in the class InMemoryTranslator. These include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Removing &quot;lock data rows&quot; and such from Sybase</li>
                        <li>Removing mentions of &quot;clustered&quot; for indices</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You have two options to convert to an in-memory database:</p>

            <subsection name="Option 1 - use the inMemoryDbType variable in your system-config.xml">
                <p>In your system-config.xml, you define the type for your system via the "dbSystemConfig type="SYBASE_ASE"".</p>

                <p>At the dbEnvironment level, you can then specify the inMemoryDbType to facilitate the conversion from the
                    system type to the in-memory environment type, per the example below.
                </p>

                <p>You can then use the standard DbEnvironmentFactory API to access the environment and build the DbDeployerAppContext.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>HOWEVER</b>, if you are re-creating the DB across tests, please reuse the DbDeployerAppContext instance
                    as to save time in reloading your db files from disk.
                </p>


                <source><![CDATA[<dbEnvironment name="BOSI_A_1"
            cleanBuildAllowed="true"
            jdbcUrl="jdbc:hsqldb:mem:unit1inmem" inMemoryDbType="HSQL"
            defaultUserId="sa"
            defaultPassword=""
            >
]]></source>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Option 2 - Use the UnitTestDbBuilder to convert the environment in memory">
                <p>There is a wrapper API also available to build the in-memory database by using a reference env from
                    your environments and optionally overriding some values.
                </p>

                <p>This option
                    <b>
                        <i>will cache the reads from file disk</i>
                    </b>
                    , so no need for you to reuse the DbDeployerAppContext
                    from the wrapper API
                </p>

                You can just include this in maven to get access to the utility:
                <source><![CDATA[<properties>
    <deployanywhere.version>4.1.0</deployanywhere.version>
</properties>
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.gs.deployanywhere</groupId>
        <artifactId>deployanywhere-db-unittest</artifactId>
        <version>${deployanywhere.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.gs.deployanywhere</groupId>
        <artifactId>deployanywhere-db-hsql</artifactId>  <!-- or deployanywhere-db-h2 -->
        <version>${deployanywhere.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
]]></source>

                And here is some sample code to build the DB:
                <source><![CDATA[DbDeployerAppContext context = UnitTestDbBuilder.newBuilder()
    .setSourcePath("platforms/db2/step1")
    .setReferenceEnvName("unittestrefh2")  // mention the environment name that you want to model off
    .setEnvName("myUnitTestDb")  // optionally - rename the environment if you are changing it from the reference
    .setDbPlatform(new H2DbPlatform())  // you can override the platform in code, or do it in the XML as mentioned in option 1
    .setDbServer("mydb2testH2")  // setting this value is a shortcut to generate the JDBC url for this environment for you if not already specified
    .buildContext();

// Once you have the reference to the DbDeployerAppContext, the code remains the same.
context.setupEnvInfra();
context.cleanEnvironment();
context.deploy();

System.out.println("This is my JDBC url for reference - " + context.getEnvironment().getJdbcUrl());]]></source>
            </subsection>
        </section>
        <section name="Manually defining a translation SQL">
            <p>The translation logic works for most cases, but at times it will not.</p>

            <p>To define your own SQL, leverage the include/exclude platforms functionality to define the SQL for your
                regular environments separately from the in-memory environments, e.g.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
//// CHANGE name="myChange" excludePlatforms="HSQL,H2"
My DB2-compatible SQL
