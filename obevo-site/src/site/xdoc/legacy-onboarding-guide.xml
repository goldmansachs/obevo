        <section name="Legacy Onboarding Guide for Legacy Systems">
            <p>This onboarding mode is for systems that are about to be retired and for which you only want to handle
                production deployments in a controlled manner, while eschewing the benefits of testability and having your
                DB objects in code as mentioned in the<a href="onboarding-guide.html">Onboarding Guide</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Onboarding to this mode is pretty simple. All you need to do is the same steps you applied in the kata example, e.g.:
                <ol>
                    <li>Add your production environment details to your system-config.xml file</li>
                    <li>Define your DB changes in your source code</li>
                    <li>Go through to your regular build/package/deploy process and execute the deploy w/ the Obevo API</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>Note that there is no reverse-engineering concept here; i.e. if your tables already exist in production, then
                do not try to also create a "CREATE TABLE" statement in your files as well, just the alters. For newly-created
                tables, then it is okay to add the "CREATE TABLE" statement.
            </p>

            <p>If you do still seek to have your "create table" definitions in code, please look at the
                <a href="onboarding-guide.html">Onboarding Guide</a>
                and see the "Existing Systems" options.
