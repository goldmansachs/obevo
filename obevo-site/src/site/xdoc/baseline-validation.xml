        <section name="Using the baseline comparison feature to validate that your CHANGEs match your baseline">
            <p>If you provide a file w/ ends with .baseline.&lt;extension&gt;, this counts as the baseline file.
                This is only used when you run DeployAnywhere in validateBaseline mode.
                the maven plugin in validateBaseline mode (see the pom example below)
            </p>
            <p>Two ways to run this:</p>

                BaselineValidatorMain
                com.gs.obevo.db.apps.baselineutil.BaselineValidatorMain class
                ? calculateBaselineBreaks will return a list of breaks
                ? validateNoBaselineBreaks is a convenience method to fail if breaks exist

            <section name="How it works:">
            <ul>
                <li>First runs a -cleanFirst deployment against your environment using your regular files (i.e. w/
                    the
                    CHANGEs)
                    <ul>
                        <li>And queries the table metadata and stores in memory, as to remember what was deployed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Then does another -cleanFirst deployment, this time using the .baseline. files where it finds
                    them in
                    place of the regular table files. (if a table file does not have a corresponding baseline file,
                    it just
                    runs the original baseline file)
                    <ul>
                        <li>And queries the table metadata and stores in memory, as to remember what was deployed
                            this
                            time
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Then does a comparison of the metadata objects for the tables. If there is a break, then it
                    fails
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can leverage this at build time to ensure that {+}{+}<i>if you change your Hibernate/Mithra/Java
                model
                files, that it will stay in sync with the changes you deploy to your DB</i>. Nice benefit, huh?
            </p>
            <p>(yes, it would be nice if the tool went a step further and figured out the alter commands for you and
                you
                never saw them. That is the holy grail...)
