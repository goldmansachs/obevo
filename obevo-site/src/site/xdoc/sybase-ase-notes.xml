        <section name="Sybase stored procedures for quotes and temp tables">
            <p>For teams that have a lot of Sybase stored procedures, you may hit the following two use cases:</p>
            <subsection name="Supporting Quoted Identifiers">
                <p>
                    <b>The Problem</b>
                    In ANSI SQL, you use single-quotes to represent strings, not double-quotes. Double-quotes would tie
                    to
                    identifiers in the DB (e.g. column names, tables names, in case they have spaces)
                </p>
                <p>For Sybase, this is also true if you connect via JDBC, but for whatever reason, it is not true if you
                    connect
                    via the isql command line - see
                    <a class="externalLink"
                        href="http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.infocenter.dc38151.1510/html/iqrefbb/CACIIHCI.htm">
                        Sybase's doc for more info
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>Hence, if you deployed stored procedures via isql, and then try to re-deploy via isql or
                    Obevo in
                    its default setting, you will get an error, as the SP will have double-quotes
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Solution</b>
                </p>
                <p>If you specify the metadata annotation //// METADATA DISABLE_QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS, then
                    Obevo will turn off the quotedidentifier option so that the double-quotes will be treated
                    as
                    strings. It will then turn it back on for subsequent deployments
                </p>
                <p>Note that the Obevo reverse-engineering step mentioned earlier will automatically add this
                    annotation if it sees a double-quote in the text. (Though there is a chance that it is actually
                    intended as
                    an identifier, the likely case is that it was intended as a string. You should try to recall if the
                    SP was
                    originally deployed via isqlto help your decision)if you do the reverse-engineering steps above,
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Temp Tables as Input to Stored Procedures">
                <p>In Costar, we've had some cases where a stored procedure required a temp table to be populated for
                    running
                    the stored procedure. However, to create the SP, we need the temp table created in the first place
                </p>
                <p>To do this, you can do this in the sp sql file itself, but just remember to add the temp table
                    beforehand and
                    then to drop it, e.g.
                </p>
                <source><![CDATA[create table #mytemp (a int, b int)
go
create proc PopulateSelectTradeTemps() as
...
select * from #mytemp
...
end
go
drop #mytemp]]></source>
                <p>(not that we'd want to do something like this in the age of Java and Mithra/Hibernate, but this is
                    here in
                    case you need it.
                </p>

        <section name="Interesting/unhelpful error messages when dealing w/ Sybase - see the FAQ">
            <p>Compared to the other DBMS types supported by Obevo, Sybase has a lot of interesting error and error
                messages (or lack of helpful error messages).
            </p>

            <p>Please see the
                <a href="faq.html">FAQ pages</a>
                for more information
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Duplicate index names allowed in Sybase but not in in-memory DBs">
            <p>Sybase allows for indices not to have unique names given they refer to different tables. This is not
                supported by the in-memory databases.
            </p>
            <p>To work around this, you can use a marker tag in system-config.xml as shown below. This will force
                all
                indices in a schema to be prefixed with a table name in test mode.
            </p>
