        <section name="Obevo Problem Statement - A Compiler for Stateful and Stateless Code Classes">
            <p>Design goal of Obevo - to give idempotent deploy semantics onto a platform target that does not
                have it by default, the keys problem to solve being:
                <ol>
                    <li>There is no existing mechanism to take a full binary of code and deploy it to upgrade an environment</li>
                    <li>Some objects within the environment are stateless, thus requiring incremental commands to modify them (and making #1 difficult)</li>
                    <li>There is no default ordering mechanism for object changes to the environment; must be manually defined by users.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Databases happen to hit all 3 points, notably for applying SQL DDL changes to DB
                schemas, per
                <a href="overview.html">the overview</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>#1: There is no mechanism currently defined by DBMS providers to define a full schema definition in
                        source code and apply the results to a database that can work both against a blank and existing db
                    </li>
                    <li>#2a: Table modifications cannot be expressed by
                        simply presenting a full view of the object definition. Instead, one must provide an incremental
                        modification statement to alter the table, and changes should only be applied once, lest an exception is
                        hit or data applied in duplicate.
                    </li>
                    <li>#2b: At the same time, other DB objects are stateless (unlike tables), where one can simply drop and add
                        objects to recreate them. Such objects like stored procedures and views share semantics more similar to
                        application code.
                    </li>
                    <li>#3:When deploying a full database, order must be considered to deploy dependency objects before the
                        ones depending on them (e.g. deploying a table before the view that depends on it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>


            <p>Noting point #2, each object type (stateful vs. stateless) have different ways to maintain them, and a
                tool should ideally be able to handle them both. This is the premise and value-add of Obevo.
            </p>

            <p>Boiling down the core problem and design - it actually does not involve SQL or DB constructs at all.
                Instead,
                it is about managing code files in the stateless and stateful manners and applying changes to them to
                the
                target environment. The end result is a "mini-compiler" of sorts; hence, the title of this section.
            </p>

            <p>This page details the generic pattern here on compiling stateful and stateless code for an underlying
                system
                that only accepts incremental changes. As of today, the implementations have been around RDBMS, but
                we've
                already started to venture into NoSQL where not all operations need SQL (Hive), and depending on the
                creative
                minds out there, we can apply this to more.
            </p>

            <p>Let's lay out the main actor involved in a System, at least with regards to this problem statement:</p>

                    </td>
                    <td>A database / set of databases on some known schemas</td>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </section>
        <section name="Requirements for Stateful objects / run-once statements">
            <p>For any given deployment activity, a set of statements need to be applied to a target environment.</p>

            <p>As mentioned earlier, statements on stateful objects must only be run once, and the state of an
                environment
                over time is the accumulation of such statements applied to it.
            </p>

            e.g.
            <ul>
                <li>Binary Version 1 - apply statements 1, 2, 3</li>
                <li>Binary Version 2 - apply statements 4, 5</li>
                <li>Binary Version 3 - apply statements 6, 7, 8</li>
            </ul>

            We present two ways to do this:
            <ol>
                <li>The Deploy Team notes which statement/s from the Source Code need to be applied for that migration
                </li>
                <li>The Deploy Tool takes the full set of statements from the Source Code and figures out which ones
                    need to
                    be applied to the environment
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Option 1 was the way teams did this without automation. Tooling-wise, it is quite simple; but it is a
                riskier endeavor as it leaves more responsibility on a human operator.
            </p>

            <p>Option 2 is what most database deployment tools do. We detail that now.</p>

            </subsection>
            <subsection name="ChangeKey to match Source Code and Deploy Log">
                <p>Step 3 is to calculate the ChangeSet between the Source Code and Deploy Log. This implies some kind
                    of
                    key that can identify a Change to facilitate this match. The choice of type to use (e.g. number,
                    string)
                    does not matter.
                </p>

                <p>The ChangeKey will be stored in the Deploy Log when applying the change so that it can be used
                    later.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Stateful Changes: No modifying or deleting already deployed changes allowed">
                <p>As mentioned earlier, statements on stateful objects must only be run once, and the state of an
                    environment
                    over time is the accumulation of such statements applied to it. (yes, we mention this fact again -
                    it plays a key role!)
                </p>

                <p>That means we cannot modify a Change entry in the Source Code once it is deployed, as otherwise the
                    deploy tool will not know how to apply the difference. The modification must either be to add a new
                    Change or to rollback/delete the change per the specifications of the tool (if supported).
                </p>

                <p>To guard against such user actions, a hash of the Change text is stored in the Deploy Log. Upon
                    subsequent releases, a hash is taken of the Change in Source Code to compare against the hash from
                    the
                    Deploy Log. (a hash is taken instead of storing the full text for space efficiency).
                </p>

                <p>To summarize the hash difference behavior for Stateful Changes:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>

        <section name="Sorting Changes in the file-per-object format">
            <p>The file-per-object format that Obevo chose has many benefits, but it adds some complexity in the tool's
                implementation, namely: how to define the order of the changes?
            </p>

            <p>With the file-per-migration format, it is simpler to just order by the files; but the file-per-object
                format would likely require some ordering constraints across changes. In this section, we discuss how
                this is handled.

            <p>Let's look at the source code example above, redrawn as a graph:
                <ol>
                    <li>Each filled box represents a Change</li>
                    <li>The stateful table* files consist of many changes, and the stateless view* file only has a single change.</li>
                    <li>The arrows represent order dependencies among the changes, notably:</li>
                    <li>view1 depends on table2 and table3 per the SQL definition (an explicit code dependency)</li>
                    <li>table3's foreign key depends on table1 to be created (an explicit code dependency)</li>
                    <li>The Changes listed within a stateful object must be done in order (an implicit dependency based on the order in the file)</li>
                    <li>Note that changes not related via arrows (whether directly or transitively) don't have any dependency order, e.g. table1.init and table2.init can be executed in any order.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <img src="images/dependency-graph.jpg" />

            <p>Given that graph, an acceptable deployment order can be obtained using<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>.
                Please read the link for more information.
            </p>

            <p>[Developer Guide note - the topological sorting is implemented (with the help of<a

                <b>com.gs.obevo.impl.graph.GraphSorter]</b>
            </p>

            <p>For the example above, we have a number of acceptable topological sorts:
                <ol>
                    <li>table1.init, table1.alter1, table1.index, table1.alter2, table3.init, table3.alter2, table3.fk1, table2.init, table2.ind1, view1</li>
                    <li>table2.init, table2.ind1, table3.init, table3.alter2, table1.init, table1.alter1, table1.index, table1.alter2, table3.fk1, view1</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>For easier supportability by clients, we will tune the topological sorting algorithm to give a consistent sorting.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Defining and discovering dependencies in Source Code">
            <p>One detail left for this algorithm - how is the dependency graph created from the source code? Specifically the
                explicit code dependencies, which require some sort of parsing of the code. Parsing code is not a trivial problem;
                to do it correctly, we would need ASTs for the coding language of the text, and that may not be easily avaiable
                or easy to implement.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Part 1:</b>
                The simplest methology is to avoid parsing entirely by defining a metadata attribute on each Change
                for the dependencies. This would technically work, however it will not scale well for developers if there
                are hundreds (or thousands) of code files to maintain. But this method will still prove useful; we will com
                back to this.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Part 2:</b>
                We can discover the dependencies in text using a rudimentary technique:
                <ol>
                    <li>We have the object names (based on the directory structure) and the text of the code</li>
                    <li>For each Change, search for references to those object names. Whichever object names are found in the text are counted as dependencies.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>[Developer Guide note - this technique is implemented in
                <b>com.gs.obevo.impl.text.TextDependencyExtractor]</b>
            </p>

            <p>From the example above:
                <ol>
                    <li>The object name list is: table1, table2, table3, view1</li>
                    <li>The text for view1 is as follows, with the obect names in red and italicized
                        <br />
                        <table border="1">
                            <tr>
                                <td>CREATE VIEW

                                    <font color="red">

                    <li>Excluding the object's own name (view1), we find that table2 and table3 are dependencies.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Part 3:</b>
                What if our rudimentary technique doesn't work? We may find false positives or false negatives.
            </p>

            <p>In this case, fall back to the metadata tag option mentioned in part 1. We either let clients:
                <ol>
                    <li>Override the programmatic calculation by defining their list</li>
                    <li>Supplement the programmatic calculation by specifying dependencies to add (fixing the false negatives)</li>
                    <li>Supplement the programmatic calculation by specifying dependencies to remove (fixing the false positives)</li>
                </ol>

        <section name="Putting it together - integrating DB Deployments and Other Platforms">
            <p>Thus far, we have not had any specific DB or SQL imprints in the algorithms (The text parsing algorithm
                could work with any language).
            </p>
            <p>The points where DB-specific (or any other platform-specific) log would go are:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Apply Changeset to Platform" - this point in the algorithm takes the Change as input; how to
                        actually apply the change is platform-specific
                    </li>
                    <li>Deploy Log implementation - this should ideally co-exist w/ the environment (e.g. a table in the
                        DB for DB platforms), but that is not an absolute requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>"Read Changes from Source Code" - the structure to impose for a platform on users can be defined
                        as an implementation desires.
