/**
 * The interface through which to access the database for {@link DbPlatform} implementations.
 *
 * While JdbcHelper does the actual SQL invocation, we must access it from this class due to the complexities around
 * accessing the data source, notably that:
 * 1) We need to set the schema for the duration of a connection across many API calls
 * 2) For Sybase IQ, we must explicitly have a different connection to change schemas as edits are done by connecting
 * as that schema user.
 *
 * Along with that, this class is used to "set the context" of the data source, i.e. assign a single connection of the
 * data source to a thread. This is akin to a transaction manager or txn management context in JTA
 *
 * This class is a bit convoluted now; could be simpler to just resort to passing a connection around. That will be a
 * refactor for a later time...
